# LLM-slingshot
LLM-assisted modified slingshot script optimized for SeuratV5 objects and SCT assay with reductions as embeddings
The script was generated using a precise and tailored prompt fed to Gemini-3 Pro based on slingshot script taken from the original [vignette](https://rdrr.io/bioc/slingshot/f/vignettes/conditionsVignette.Rmd)
The modified script also enhances plot visualization
